### Q. Can I claim an unclaimed build?

A:

    Case 1:

    If a person's land expires due to them being inactive, then the building that was protected is fair game. Anyone can destroy it if they wish / claim it as their own.

    Case 2:

    If the owner of the claim decides to unclaim it for reasons such as to expand the size, move the claim, or make it smaller; the buildings inside the claim still belongs to the owner. If they fail to reclaim in within 5 days, then it's also fair game.(You'll need an alternative way for staff to prove that this build / claim if yours or else the 5 days won't apply.)
